**Hello! This page is dedicated to my code quality and formatting if you're concerned about my structuring / organization of code since it's likely that you're hiring me and I am going to be part of a team! (NOTE: Scripts are packed into a single one for the sake of reading; I use ModuleScripts to refractor and organize most of my projects.)** ðŸ’»
